Business Intelligence Project – Product Catalog Analysis for Specialized Supply Stores
📌 Project Overview

This project develops an end-to-end Business Intelligence (BI) solution for a chain of specialized supply stores offering tools, hydraulic equipment, trailer parts, agricultural products, and workshop supplies.
